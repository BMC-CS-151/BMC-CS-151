## Overview

In this assignment, we will use the `ExpandableArray` you started
implementing in lab and practice object-oriented design with inheritance. 
<br>
You will be building on top of your Assignment 1. 

<br>
There is now a second
input file `ziplocs.csv` which gives information about zipcodes and their associated latitudes and longitudes (as decimal numbers), among other things (but not
population). Your task this week is to weave these two files together and organize
the data into classes stored in an `ExpandableArray` that allows us to perform similiar
lookups as those in Assignement 1.

One of the important goals of this class is to train you to become successful independent programmers who can translate a problem on paper to fully functional
code that solves the problem. Thus, each assignment is designed to give you less
detailed instructions. You will notice that for example, unlike Assignment 1, this
assignment no longer contains exact method signatures or details of any instance
variables. Instead, you are asked to think about what instance variables are 
necessary and reasonable in order to accomplish the tasks given here. In addition, not
having exact method signatures doesn’t mean anything goes. You are expected to
design functional and efficient methods much like those you had before. In other
words, Assignment 1 gave you an exact design you just had to implement. This
assignment asks you to flesh out a design much in the same style - basic steps are
still listed for you - see Sections 2 and 3. I am happy to discuss design questions
during lecture, lab or office hours of course.

All programming assignments will go through an autograder on Gradescope. 
The autograder will test for correctness.
We are providing you some public tests that you can use on your own.

In this assignment, your driver program should be called
`DriverHW01.java`.

In addition, please read the program design principles and code formatting
standards carefully. You are expected to adhere to all stated standards. Violations will result in deductions.

> Requirement: You can ONLY include the following import statements:
>
> import java.io.File;
>
> import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
>
> import java.util.Scanner;
>
>You are NOT ALLOWED to include any other import statements in your solutions. That means
you cannot use any built-in java data structures.

## 1 Input File Format
The file `ziplocs.csv` contains a header line at the top with column names, but
it does not list the number of entries in the file. Thereafter, the lines contain 12
comma-separated fields that look like this:

```
"07677","STANDARD","WOODCLIFF LAKE","NJ","PRIMARY",41.02,-74.05,"NA-US-NJ-WOODCLIFF LAKE","false",2945,5471,325436960
```

We will only use three of these fields, the zipcode (#1), the latitude (#6) and the
longitude (#7). In the sample line, that is 07677 (in quotes), 41.02 and -74.05.
As in the last assignment, some lines are missing some information, but all lines
have the correct number of commas (11).

In your last assignment, you only read the zipcode, town and state fields from
uszipcodes.csv, but ignored the population information. You will now read the
total population field in uszipcodes.csv as well (if the line contains the 
total population).

By collating the data between `uszipcodes.csv` and `ziplocs.csv`, we 
can categorize all zipcodes into one of three categories: 
1. `PopulatedPlace` - zipcodes with a population and location, 
2. `LocatedPlace` - zipcodes with a location only, 
3. `Place` - zip codes without either. 

These types naturally form an inheritance hierarchy, where
`PopulatedPlace` is a subclass of `LocatedPlace` (every `PopulatedPlace` is also a
`LocatedPlace`) and `LocatedPlace` is a subclass of `Place` (every `LocatedPlace` is
also a `Place`).

## 2. LocatedPlace

Write a new class `LocatedPlace` that is a subclass of `Place`. 
Include appropriate instance variables, constructor and getters.

The `LocatedPlace` class must have an overridden `toString` method that
includes the location information in the string returned. For example, a
`LocatedPlace` representing Bryn Mawr would return the string

```
Bryn Mawr, PA 40.02 -75.31
```

## 3. PopulatedPlace

Write a new class `PopulatedPlace` that is a subclass of `LocatedPlace`. Include appropriate instance variables, constructor and getters.

The `PopulatedPlac` class must also override the `toString` method to include the place’s population in the string. A `PopulatedPlace` representing
Bryn Mawr should return the string 

```Bryn Mawr, PA 40.02 -75.31 21103```

## 4. LookupZip

Modify the `readZipCodes` method from `LookupZip` to read both data files,
constructing an `ExpandableArray` of `Places` and returns it. 
The method should now take in two arguments.
If a place’s population
is known, it will be represented by a `PopulatedPlace` object; otherwise, if a
place’s location is known, it will be represented by a `LocatedPlace` object;
otherwise it will be represented by a `Place` object.

Note that this new version returns an `ExpandableArray`, not an array. You need to
adapt your old `parseLine` or `lookupZip` methods or both.

> Requirement: One restriction is that `readZipCodes` should read each file only once: that
is, you should create a new `Scanner` for each file only once, not repeatedly.
You should also not reset these `Scanners`. You should read in one file first,
create objects to accumulate the partial data in that file, and then read the
other file, combining the entries appropriately. Note that the zipcodes in the
files are not in the same order.

## 5. DriverHW01
You can copy the driver from your last homework assignment
into a new file called `DriverHW01.java`

Update the `main` method to work with your new methods. Recall that the
appropriate `toString()` will be used when you print your three different
objects of the `Place` type hierachy.

Here’s a sample session of running your driver:

```
zipcode: 19010
Bryn Mawr, PA 40.02 -75.31 21103

zipcode: 99400
No such zipcode

zipcode: 91729
Rancho Cucamonga, CA 34.09 -117.56

zipcode: 97252
Portland, OR

zipcode: 00000
Good Bye! 
```

## Design Considerations

BEFORE you start programming, you should think about these design questions
and come up with answers for them:

1. How do you determine if a zipcode should be a `PopulatedPlace`, a `LocatedPlace`, or
just a `Place`?
2. The total population field in `uszipcodes.csv` is not filled out for some lines.
How do you detect that it is missing? Hint: research `split` and learn about
the overloaded version with a second parameter limit.
3. When the population field is not filled for a zipcode in `uszipcodes.csv`,
what object do you construct? And if the field is not empty, what object do you construct?
4. Read `uszipcodes.csv` first. After you are done reading `uszipcodes.csv`,
what data structure do you have and how have you populated it?
5. Then read `ziplocs.csv`. As you read each line, how do you collate the
information you have with the data you already collected and stored from
`uszipcodes.csv`?
6. The zipcode field in `ziplocs.csv` has double quotes around it. You should
remove the quotes (after reading in - don’t modify the input file!) or you will
not be able to match them with the zipcodes found in `uszipcodes.csv`. I
recommend using `replace` from the Java `String` library (use the Java API
reference to find out how).

## README.txt

In a text file called `README.txt` answer the following questions:

1. How much time did you spend on the homework
1. What did you learn from this homework
1. optional: What did you struggle with during this homework
1. optional: any other feedback you would like to share

## Submitting

Submit the following files to the assignment called `HW01` on Gradescope:

1. `DriverHW01.java`
2. `Place.java`
2. `LocatedPlace.java`
2. `PopulatedPlace.java`
3. `LookupZip.java`
4. `ExpandableArray.java`
4. `README.txt`

Make sure to name these files exactly what we specify here. Otherwise,
our autograders might not work and we might have to take points off.
<br>
**DO NOT** submit a *.docx* or *.pdf* file.
<br>
**DO NOT** submit any `.class` files or any of the `csv` files.

#### Copying the files 
You will likely want to submit the files from your own laptop/computer.
To copy the files from `goldengate` to your own machine, 
open up a terminal on your own computer. If you have a mac or linux, you can use the 
Terminal application, if you have a windows you can use the Powershell app.

Run the following command:

```bassh
$ scp <username>@goldengate.cs.brynmawr.edu/home/<username>/cs151/homeworks/hw00/*
```

Make sure to replace `<username>` with your username. `scp` is a command to secure-copy files
from one server to another. In this case, from `goldengate` to your own machine.
