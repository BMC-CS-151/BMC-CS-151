## Overview

Rewrite your HW 1 to use more efficient searching techniques. Specifically,
the zipcodes in `uszipcodes.csv` are already listed in lexicographic order and thus
your `ExpandableArray` will naturally be sorted by zipcodes after you are done processing
this file - verify that it is so.

### Lab 6 (Iterators)

Since Lab06 was more involved than the other labs,
Lab06 will count towards this homework grade. 
In turn, you can re-submit Lab06 until {{page.due_date}}

## LookupZip
Modify the `lookupZip` method to use binary search instead. 
You must implement a binary search from scratch and 
you are not allowed to use Java’s
built-in `Collections.binarySearch`. Note also that object comparisons
should be done via `compareTo`.

If you didn’t call lookupZip when you were weaving in the data from ziplocs.csv,
you should rewrite that other lookup method to use your binary search too.

## Requirements.

The rest of the restrictions and requirements for Assignment 1 remain. 
Testing should use the same test files as Assignment 1 as well.

## Testing

For this assignment you do not need to write any JUnit tests.
However, your code must pass the checkstyle.

In this assignment we will use commandline redirection.

Instead of typing zipcode inputs as you are prompted, you can write them in a file and pass them to your program as follows:     
`java DriverHW04 uszipcodes.csv ziplocs.csv < in.txt`
     
Where `in.txt` contains the zipcodes you want to test with one on each line. Remember to end with our exit code: 00000.
Test with the sample session in HW1. 

Time your old and new implementation by running:
`time java DriverHW04 uszipcodes.csv ziplocs.csv < in.txt`

Compare the result with your Assignment 1 implementation. Is there a
speedup? Report your findings in your README.

## Submitting

Submit the following files to the assignment called `HW04` on Gradescope

1. `DriverHW04.java`
2. `Place.java`
3. `LocatedPlace.java`
4. `PopulatedPlace.java `
5. `LookUpZip.java`
6. `README.txt`

and Lab files:  
7. `ArrayList.java`  
8. `List.java`    
9. `MyIterator.java`  
10. `TestIterator.java`   
11. `TestMyListIterator.java`  
12. `TestRemovePositions.java`  


Make sure to name these files exactly what we specify here. Otherwise,
our autograders might not work and we might have to take points off.
<br>
**DO NOT** submit a *.docx* or *.pdf* file.
<br>
**DO NOT** submit any `.class` files or any of the `csv` files.
<br>
**DO NOT** submit any of the provided interfaces. We will use the ones
we provide for testing.

#### Copying the files 
You will likely want to submit the files from your own laptop/computer.
To copy the files from `goldengate` to your own machine, 
open up a terminal on your own computer. If you have a mac or linux, you can use the 
Terminal application, if you have a windows you can use the Powershell app.

Run the following command:

```bassh
$ scp <username>@goldengate.cs.brynmawr.edu/home/<username>/cs151/homeworks/hw00/*
```

Make sure to replace `<username>` with your username. `scp` is a command to secure-copy files
from one server to another. In this case, from `goldengate` to your own machine.
