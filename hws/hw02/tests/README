The *.txt files are the correct outputs for a selection of the male and female baby names. Look at the lines in run_tests that start with "java DriverHW02" to see how they were generated.

We’re providing these as a sanity check, but also to demo the output format we’ll be grading for.

To use this test program, copy the entire directory test/ in the base directory of your program (HW03/).  All the csv's should be stored in the same directory under a directory called names/.  Then type (from HW03/):

cd babynamesTest
/usr/bin/bash run_tests

No errors should occur if your program files are setup correctly.  You should see "No errors in testing!" as the output.

If you do not, review the sample output file in the specified case and compare it to your output. 

In the case where a name does not occur in a year, you should NOT show that year in the printout
